* About Jake

I am a hacker (in the lisp sense!) with one foot in lisp and the other in parallelisation.

R is a wonderful, lively, resource-rich medium (fact about me ?).

[[https://sci.waikato.ac.nz/about-us/people/cree][Michael Cree]] instilled practical sysadmin skills (and physics/imaging science) in me, I hope!

[[https://www.luminate.one/][Luminate One]] in Matamata, NZ is where I work.

Please see my [[https://linkedin.com/in/jacob-pouw-waas-a21a91176][LinkedIn]] for a little more.
